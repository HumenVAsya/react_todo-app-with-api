Implemented:

- A single-page application (SPA) for managing a To-Do list, with features for adding, deleting, updating, and filtering tasks.

- The app supports task filtering by status (all, active, completed), toggling all tasks as completed/uncompleted, and deleting completed tasks.

- Error handling for server interactions, with error notifications that can be dismissed.

Technologies Used:

- React: For building components and managing the application's state.

- TypeScript: For ensuring type safety throughout the application.

- API interactions to load, add, update, and delete tasks.
